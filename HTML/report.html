    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p>Here is an itemized breakdown of how we believe we have met the expectations listed in the project guidelines. 
    </p>

    <p>Our client was our friend Charlie.</p>

    <p>Our web pages do include a header, take for example our 
        home page, which has a header of picture and text:</p>
        <img src="/images/pic1.png" height="300" width="800">

    <p>Our website has at least 10 different pages. 10 including a 
        Home page,
        Contact page,
        Careers page,
        Environment page,
        Salsa vs. Picante info page,
        Newsletter page,
        FAQ page,
        Testimonials,
        Recipes page,
        About chuck page
        </p>

        <p>Our website has a navigation bar as seen here:        </p>
        <img src="/images/pic2.png"height="200" width="500">

        <p>Yes, we have responsive design for our website, as you can see in our 
            recipe page for example, the cards condense into smaller sized columns 
            as the screen shrinks
        </p>

        <p>We have a global style sheet for our pages shared with each other in 
            Github as you can see here. All other styling is saved in separate css 
            documents. Shared style sheet is named “style.css”.</p>
            <img src="/images/pic3.png">

            <p>Our images have alt attributes, for example you can see it in action 
                on one of our pages: 
            </p>
            <img src="/images/pic4.png"height="100" width="1100">

            <p>We have a favicon linked in the head tag, shown here as an example 
                for on eof our pages: 
            </p>
            <img src="/images/pic5.png">

            <p>
                Our site is organized and separated based on .html, .css, and photo files. 
                Here is what our visual studio code environment looks like: note the different 
                folders on the left
            </p>
            <img src="reportpics/pic6.png"height="900" width="300">

            <p>If you look at our webpages code, you will see that we use no sort of 
                Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools.
            </p>

            <p>Our pages have been run through the css and html validators used in class: 
            </p>
            <img src="reportpics/pic9.png"height="400" width="800">
            <img src="reportpics/pic10.png"height="400" width="800">

            <p>Our project is stored in a Github location as shown below:
            </p>
            <img src="reportpics/pic8.png">

            <p>Our files are entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters. </p>
            <img src="reportpics/pic11.png">

            <p>Our content is neatly aligned and there are no oddities</p>

            <p>Our pages used different font families including Trebuchet and Didot</p>

            <p>Our contact page for example linked to social media websites for 
                the user to see chucks social media which was an external link
            </p>

            <p>Our source code is easy to understand and has names of classes that 
                make sense and are not difficult to understand or nonsensical </p>
                <img src="reportpics/pic12.png"height="500" width="400">

            <p>Our webpage has a consistent navbar implemented into all of our pages
            </p>

            <p>Our webpage has a header shown above, and a footer here that are on all pages:
            </p>
            <img src="reportpics/pic13.png">

            <p>Our website uses flexboxes and an example is shown below, 
                in our css file styling these flex boxes:
            </p>
            <img src="reportpics/pic14.png"height="400" width="400">

            <p>Critique from Charlie:
                "I liked working with the guys to make a website for my salsa. They communicated 
                with me well and made a wesbite that worked and could help my picante
                business grow. They addressed my needs and made it happen, and even though they werent
                able to get a purchasing function built into the website, they offered great 
                alternatives like making the contacting page where customers can contact me directly, which
                is very nice. I liked the work they did and it was fun working with them and 
                especially coming to class with them and having everyone try my picante."
